## Description

I recently updated my portfolio that I first created back in August 2022. It's a web app that I built using React, which was my first time using that technology. In February 2023, I decided to do a total overhaul and redesign of the portfolio. The new version is much more focused and streamlined, with just the stuff that I thought would be most helpful for potential employers or anyone who wants to check it out. As a result, this current iteration offers a simplified and concise presentation. As part of the redesign, I made some changes to the navigation. I got rid of links that didn't really add much value, and I restructured the site to make it a single-page application. I added some subtle animations to the social icons when on desktop view and kept the design clean with a simple color scheme and modern fonts.
